- We are using Rust edition of 2024
- Follow the Rust style guide for naming conventions and formatting
- Implement best practices for code organization and maintainability
- Use Repository-centric API design with static lifecycle methods (init, open) and instance methods for operations
- Always call Repository::ensure_git() before git operations to validate git availability
- Use PathBuf for internal path handling, &Path for method parameters and returns
- Run `cargo build && cargo test` after code changes
